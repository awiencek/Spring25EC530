#Mission of the module:  If the user gives you two arrays of geo location, match each point in the first array to the closest one in the second array

#How to calculate the distance between two GPS locations
#latitude, longitude   (degrees, minutes, seconds)
#Haversine formula (for distance in km)
#D = 6378*arccos[sin(latA)*sin(latB)+cos(latA)*cos(latB)*cos(longA-longB)]

#earth's radius is 6378 km

#function definition: two array inputs, return float output
#array inputs should be structured as follows:
#northern latitudes should be written as positive values, southern as negative values
#eastern longitudes should be written as positive values, western as negative values

def gps_distance(place1, place2):
  float distance
  
  #convert degrees to radians
  latA = math.radians(place1[0])
  latB = math.radians(place2[0])
  longA = math.radians(place1[1])
  longB = math.radians(place2[1])
  
  #calculation for distance
  distance = 6378*arccos[sin(latA)*sin(latB)+cos(latA)*cos(latB)*cos(longA-longB)]
  
  return distance
