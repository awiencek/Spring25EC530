# Find the closest airport to a city
# First Input:  list of major world cities:  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joelacus/world-cities/refs/heads/main/world_cities.csv 
# Second Vector:  List of major world airports:  https://github.com/ip2location/ip2location-iata-icao/blob/master/iata-icao.csv
# Future Bonus:  Make your output and input configurablesâ€¦. Pass a CSV or JSON and get the output as a JSON for the user.
# Why is that?
