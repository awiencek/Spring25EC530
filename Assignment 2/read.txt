A basic API design intended to assist in smart home planning in order to synch and manage multiple devices. Major focus has been placed on CRUD (create, read, update, delete) functions of the following entities: users, houses, rooms, devices. The management of each entity is handled in its own python file. Stub builds are included as JSON files. Github actions for testing have been listed below. Generative ai was used in the development of this exercise.







---------------------------------------
Design APIs for all entities we discussed in class:
User
House
Rooms
Devices

Develop Stub builds for the APIs

Develop unit tests for the stub functions

Utilize GitHub actions and automate the cycle

Make sure you design the data structures, errors and information back.


---planning notes---
seperate JSON files for the entities -> export into readable/nested structure
try optimmizing with pointers
put them all together, add in error messages

make the stubs

make a few test files

actions/automation
